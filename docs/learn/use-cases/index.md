## Build a Use Case

Welcome to the bonus mission of Discord missions!
Submit a PR to our documentation under this section and provide a potential use case that Centrifuge can tap into, using the following categories:

- **Through the lens of an asset originator**
  - Which markets around the world could benefit most from asset financing through centrifuge?
 Freelancers represent about 35% of the global workforce and that number is expected to continue rising over the coming years. Amid the global COVID-19 Pandemic the number of freelance workers has continued to increase at a quickening pace. A study from Upwork found that in the USA alone freelancers earned approximately $1.2 trillion in 2020. Even with these impressive numbers, one of the primary concerns for freelancers is getting paid! Oftentimes (as Centrifuge is well aware) invoices do not get paid for 30-60 days. This can be a major challenge for individuals trying to run their own business and market their skills while keeping up on business and everyday expenses especially at the beginning of their freelance career. Also consider that 59% of freelance workers claim to be living paycheck to paycheck according to research by ddiy.com.This is where Centrifuge and Tinklake can help. 

There are two ways that I could see these freelancer invoices onboarded to Centrifuge in order to receive cash advances on their invoices. A third party business could create a simple and attractive user interface with two separate portals: One for businesses employing freelancers and one for individual freelancers looking to submit their own invoices.
For businesses employing freelancers: Multiple freelancers submit invoices to their employer.‚Üí The employer uploads the batch of invoices that they have received for that week as well as any necessary documentation to their account on the third party website ‚Üí The third party business batches multiple business accounts invoices and uploads those invoices to their Tinklake Pool to attract funding for stable coin advances on these invoices. ‚Üí The business receives the funding back in their preferred currency and pays their valued freelancers earlier than the typical 30-60 day payment window.
Individual freelancers upload their invoices as well as any necessary documentation to their account on the third party website.‚ÜíThe third party business batches these individual invoices with others as well as multiple business account invoices and uploads those invoices to their Tinklake Pool to attract funding for stable coin advances on these invoices ‚Üí The individual freelancer receives the payment for their invoice in their preferred currency earlier than the typical 30-60 payment window.

- **DeFi protocol composability**
  - Centrifuge has started working with MakerDAO and Aave to create instant liquidity for Tinlake pools. What are other great partnership use cases for Centrifuge?
Efforce is a platform that allows real world businesses to become more energy efficient by tokenizing future savings on energy efficient upgrades to their buildings and other infrastructure. Their service allows more people to benefit from these energy efficiency upgrades while offering a no cost solution for businesses to benefit from the long term savings associated with using less energy in their operations. I haven‚Äôt come up with a direct integration that Centrifuge could explore with Efforce. However it may be useful to connect and share information, standards etc with other blockchain based projects financing real world use cases.
- **Centrifuge Chain (the home for RWA)**
  - Centrifuge Chain is built for RWA origination. Tinlake is a great use case of what can be done with the Centrifuge chain. What are some other cases you can see for the Centrifuge chain?
Farmers employing regenerative practices to build healthy soil, healthy plants and healthy ecosystems lack access to financing and land ownership. First, a quick description of what regenerative agriculture is followed by some stats ‚ÄúThe goal of regenerative farming systems (Rodale, 1983) is to increase soil quality and biodiversity in farmland while producing nourishing farm products profitably. Unifying principles consistent across regenerative farming systems include (1) abandoning tillage (or actively rebuilding soil communities following a tillage event), (2) eliminating spatio-temporal events of bare soil, (3) fostering plant diversity on the farm, and (4) integrating livestock and cropping operations on the land‚Äù (LaCanne, Lundgren 2018)

- farms with regenerative practices have shown to be 78% more profitable than those with only conventional practices. (LaCanne, Lundgren 2018)
- The Croation institute in their 2019 Soil Wealth report identifies ‚Äú$321.1 billion in managed assets that explicitly integrate sustainable food criteria in their investment strategies, and a smaller subset of investments - $47.5 billion - specifically related to regenerative agriculture‚Äù
- Over the last decade the average cost of farm real estate has more than doubled. Leading many farmers to rent instead of own their farmland. The largest economic incentives of regenerative farming practices pay off over the long term, usually beyond 10 years. Therefore land ownership is crucial for farmers using regenerative practices. 
- 40% of farmland in the US is owned by farmers over 65. There is a large-scale land transfer happening at this very moment. Large scale developers and farms are buying up this land at high prices. How can small scale regenerative farmers take part in this land transfer to secure land for the long term?

Where does Centrifuge come in? 
https://gosteward.com/ is an interesting crowdfunding project providing loans to small scale regenerative farmers primarily in the United States(I do not work for Steward). Their model allows small farmers to access capital that they could not otherwise receive from traditional financing options. These loans allow them to purchase land, equipment and services. If a company like Steward or one that shares the same goals were to create a pool on Tinlake it could allow access to even more capital for small scale regenerative farmers to own their own land and produce healthy soil, food, ecosystems with meaningful profits in the long term.

There may be additional advantages to building a standalone app on Centrifuge chain to enable transparent on-chain reporting of funding, usage of funds, milestone achievements as well as potentially introducing on-chain reporting of data such as soil samples. I suppose this data could also be privately updated and transferred within the P2P network by updating the document connected to the NFT within Tinlake. I belive Centrifuge is a fantastic tool for advancing social good especially in terms of opening financing oportunities to those who have no previously had access. small to medium scale Regenerative Farmers are advancing social good and are perfectly situated to benefit from additional financing if it could be offered through Centrifuge.

- **Polkadot**
  - Interoperability is crucial for DeFi‚Äôs success. What are some other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem that you think Centrifuge should integrate with?
It would be interesting to see how Centrifuge might use the self-sovereign identity protocol Kilt. A service like Kilt may provide a way for users wishing to participate in governance on the Cent Chain a way to prove their expertise in a certain subject when making a proposal. It could also offer additional support for AOs using their Centrifuge ID to add additional self sovereign claims about their viability as a provider of a certain service. Additionally using another Polkadot project, Litentry, AOs could potentially aggregate their Centrifuge ID with a Kilt ID as well as any other ID in order to use them cross chain to provide additional legitimacy and could potentially streamline their onboarding process in other DeFi applications if services like Litentry and Kilt become widely used across DeFi. In my understanding an integration of an ID service for CFG holders, Investors and AOs will further improve the access to the broader DeFi ecosystem for all parties involved. 
For any of these categories above üëâ submit a PR to detail how each use case could work. Make sure to think about the entire flow, technology, and size of the potential!
